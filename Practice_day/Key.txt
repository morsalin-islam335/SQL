The cell of first column and first cell of table is key.
Key is 3 classes
    i) Primary key
    ii) Foreign key
    iii) composite key

i) If all data of a field are unique than this key is primary key
ii) If a key is another table's primary key than this is called foreign key.
iii) If we create a primary key by using 2 or more key than the pair of these is composite key.
